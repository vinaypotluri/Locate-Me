Locate-Me
============
A location based app (Glassware) for Google Glass

**Platform:** Google Glass                                                                              
**Language:** Java                                                                                      
**Environment:** Eclipse, Android Studio                                                              


The project involved developing a Location Based app for google glass users.  Location based updates within the University Campus such as building name, address and the available resources are pushed to the glass interface in real time. The Google glass applications commonly known as Glassware are built using Glass Development Kit (GDK) and Android SDK with the help of mirror APIs for extracting data from the web. A first of its kind implementation by a University for the emerging technology.

The app is focussed initially to benefit the incoming college freshmen who are totally new to the University and need assistance. The app here acts as a virtual assistant to tour the University.


Steps:
========
1. Gets the location of the user from best available providers using criteria.
2. Geocoder API is used to decode address from latitude longitude values in real time.
3. Gets the building name based on the available address.
4. Pulls up information about the building resources from the University website.
5. Pushes all the necessary resources information to the user.
6. Voice and Notifications are triggered when the location changes.
7. Options to start and stop
8. All Exceptions are handled efficiently in Java.
